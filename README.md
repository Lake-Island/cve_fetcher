This repository contains Python scripts for fetching and maintaining a database of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). The scripts are designed to fetch new CVEs, filter them based on relevant tools and hardware, send notifications to a Discord webhook, and perform regular maintenance on the database to keep it up to date.
